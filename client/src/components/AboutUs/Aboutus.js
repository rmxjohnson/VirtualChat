      Our team is made up of 5 diverse and interesting coders with varying talents and ambitions.
      The one thing that we all have in common is that we were brought together at the Case Western Reserve Coding Bootcamp.
      Our team members include strong front-end and back-end coders.
       We sought each other out and gravitated to each other because of our talents for coding,
       creativity and ability to collaborate.
